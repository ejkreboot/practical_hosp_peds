## Allergic reactions

Allergic reactions are classified according to their pathogenesis into five "types". Knowing the types is largely academic, although their is some clinical utility in having at least a rudimentary understanding of the types as the pathophysiology determines, to some extent, treatment and clinical course. Finally, knowledge of the classification of hypersensitiviy reactions can be very useful when you run out of more practical questions with which to pepper trainees under your supervision.

| Type | Pathophysiology                                              | Time course       | Example      |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------ |
| I    | Degranulation of mast cells or basophils coated with preformed IgE specific to inciting factor, release histamine and/or tryptase. Requires prior sensitization. | Minutes to hours. | Anaphylaxis. |
| II   |                                                              |                   |              |
|      |                                                              |                   |              |

There are three ways to diagnose anaphylaxis. Minutes to hours after exposure to a known allergen for a given patient, decreased blood pressure alone is sufficient to make the diagnosis. Otherwise, after exposure to a likely allergen, two or more of skin/mucosal changes (swelling, hives, etc.), respiratory symptoms, decreased blood pressure, or GI pain or vomiting are sufficient to make the diagnosis. Otherwise, even without known exposure, skin/mucosal changes combined with either respiratory symptoms or decreased blood pressure meets diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis.

> Symptoms of anaphylaxis include:
>
> * Skin and/or mucous membrane changes (swelling, itching, urticarial rash)
> * Hypotension (relative to age or patient specific norms)
> * Respiratory symptoms (wheeze, hypoxia, difficulty in breathing)
> * Abdominal pain or vomiting.

> Diagnostic criteria:
>
> 1. Skin or mucosal changes combined with either (relative) hypotension or respiratory symptoms **or**
> 2. Exposure to likely allergen and two or more of above symptoms **or**
> 3. Exposure to known allergen and (relative) hypotension.

# Rheumatology

Rheumatologic conditions are chronic and managed by sub specialists in the outpatient realm the vast majority of the time. However, familiarity with them is important for the pediatric hospitalist for two reasons. First, there are complications of these disease processes (and their treatment) that lead to hospitalization and require specific interventions. Secondly, these diseases are the ultimate diagnosis for many patients presenting with vague constellation of symptoms. A solid foundation of knowledge about these conditions can expedite consultation and facilitate and end to the diagnostic odyssey, thereby decreasing stress for provider and patient alike.

## Emergencies and Urgencies

While one does not expect to ever hear "Code ANA Room 525" paged overhead, there are a couple of situations that may arise in patients with rheumatological diseases that require prompt intervention. 

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) arising in a patient with a rheumatologic condition is referred to as "Macrophage Activation Syndrome" (MAS), is potentially fatal, and requires prompt intervention. HLH is reviewed in the Immunology and Allergy chapter. In contrast to HLH, MAS can often be treated with steroids alone (possibly with the addition of anakinra, and any other disease modifying agents needed to control the underlying rheumatologic condition). However, patients who are very ill, or decompensating despite steroid treatment, should be transitioned to the traditional HLH-94 protocol (or a clinical trial protocol if available at your institution). The HLH-94 protocol combines etoposide and  cyclo**sporine** with intrathecal methotrexate and hydrocortisone if there are CNS symptoms. While diagnosis and treatment of HLH/MAS would be carried out with help from a rheumatologist, immunologist, and/or hematologist/oncologist, a high index of suspicion must be maintained for MAS in patients with a rheumatologic diagnosis presenting with fever, splenomegaly, CNS symptoms, and/or cytopenias. In this context, prompt acquisition of additional  laboratory evaluations (e.g. ferritin, and triglyceride levels, soluble IL2Ra/CD25 and NK cell function) and/or involvement of specialists will ensure efficient diagnosis and treatment. Note that IL2Ra/CD25 and NK cell function assays will take a while to come back, and therapy should not be delayed for deteriorating patients exhibiting other features consistent with HLH/MAS while waiting for those results.

Secondly, patients with rheumatologic conditions may be taking immunosuppressive agents. In such patients presenting with fever and an absolute neutrophil count <500, a blood culture should be drawn and broad spectrum antibiotics initiated within 60 minutes of presentation. Needless to say, patients with higher ANCs who are ill appearing also require prompt diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. While such patients typically present to the emergency department, this situation could arise in hospitalized patients during the course of their admission, so ongoing vigilance is indicated. These patients do not differ from any other patient with iatrogenic neutropenia and fever, however it is important to maintain awareness that this patient population may be neutropenic.

## Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) ##

JIA is defined as synovitis affecting one more joints for at least 6 weeks with an onset before 16 years of age. Although not terrible impactful on care of this hospitalized child, JIA is divided into seven categories, each with a unique set of clinical and laboratory features. These are summarized in the figure below. If you mentally keep the categories in the order shown, it makes it a *little* easier to remember age of onset and laboratory features. 



## Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)

Case presentation: Your 12 year old patient presents with some symptoms. What is your diagnosis? If you said "SLE" you could be right!

There are several classifications systems that can be used for making the diagnosis of SLE, of which the most recent is the 2019 EULAR/ACR system [@31385462]. While these systems are useful for clinical trials and research, as well as remembering the range of features of the disease process, it is important to remember that a patient need not meet these criteria to warrant initiation of treatment. For example, the EULAR/ACR system requires an ANA titer of 1:80 as the "entry point" into the algorithm. However, lower titers (say, up to 1:250) combined with other clinical features of SLE should prompt further investigation/consultation and therapy depending on the results of those maneuvers.

The classic symptoms of SLE are malar rash, arthritis, serositis, and nephritis. However, the presentation is often much more subtle. Unexplained constitutional symptoms (fatigue, fever, weight loss) or new onset psychosis should prompt consideration of SLE. At a minimum, in the absence of a clear alternative diagnosis, an ANA should be checked for such patients. A negative ANA reduces the probability of SLE to 1-2%, which combined with a low pre-test probability may be sufficient to rule out the diagnosis, or at least put it on the shelf for the time being. See the list below for additional clinical manifestations of SLE.

A positive ANA should prompt further laboratory investigation (CBC, renal panel, UA, C3, C4, anti-dsDNA, anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-RNP, anti-cardiolipin, lupus anti-coagulant, direct Coombs). If the patient is febrile, MAS labs (ferritin, triglycerides, IL2Ra/CD25, and NK cell function) should also be checked. If these evaluations reveal abnormalities, consultations to pediatric rheumatology and/or nephrology is indicated.

The mainstay of treatment for SLE is hydroxychloroquine. Many patients also require steroids for adequate disease control. The lowest possible dose is used (often starting at 0.25mg/kg for prednisone). If higher doses and/or prolonged courses are required, additional medications may be added to reduce steroid dependency. These typically include mycophenylate mofetil or azathioprine. For moderate to severe disease (e.g. as defined by extent of renal involvement), cyclophosphamide (<u>+</u> rituximab) be required to induce remission. Management of renal, cardiac, pulmonary, dermatologic, and hematologic complications may require additional targeted therapies.

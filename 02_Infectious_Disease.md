## Emergencies and Urgencies

There are only a few clinical entities that constitute true infectious disease emergencies. These entities are familiar, and you can probably recite the clinical definition of these disease processes (septic shock, for example). But despite our familiarity with them, most of us who have been in practice for more than a couple years can probably bring to mind episodes of delayed diagnosis and intervention for patients presenting with these pathologies. Why does this happen? Two common explanations come to mind. The first is evolution of clinical condition. 

We admit a patient with an infectious process who is not septic (or, at least, not in septic shock), and then the patient becomes septic over time. Once the intense scrutiny of the admission process is over, our minds turn to other patients and other matters. A couple of abnormal vital signs get recorded which may or may not come to our attention. Even if they come to our attention, they may be dismissed ("the patient was not cooperative", "the tachycardia is just due to the fever"). Finally, when compensated shock turns into decompensated shock, the abnormalities become impossible to ignore. We look back with dismay to realize that what we are now seeing has been developing over the course of many hours. This is a manifestation of **anchoring bias**. We have made our diagnosis, we have chosen a course of therapy. We fail to keep an open mind to the patient's disease evolving into something much more serious. What makes this particularly challening is that our "excuses" are often, in fact, correct. Fever **does** make a patient tachycardic and tachypnic. Toddlers **are** hard to get an accurate blood pressure on. Every bronchiolitic patient on our ward probably has a potentially alarming set of vitals every shift. On any given day, probably none of them have an acute vancomycin deficiency. 

The second explanation for missing the diagnosis of an infectious emergency or urgency is that some of them--while well known to us—are very rare. Necrotizing fascitis is a potentially devastating pathology that requires prompt medical and surgical management. I have wondered many times if a patient of mine was developing necrotizing fascitis. How many of these patients actually had necrotizing fascitis? Zero. (No doubt you, dear reader, have seen a pediatric case or two. But the point remains: this is an important but rare clinical entity.) But some day, I am going to come across a case. And if I become lackadaisical and stop asking myself (and my surgical colleagues) if that erythematous limb with a few slightly dusky areas is in fact manifesting a rapidly progressing streptococcal infection, I am going to miss my opportunity to promptly intervene to the patient's benefit.

How then can we pick the deteriorating patient out of the haystack of pretty sick patients for whom "staying the course" is the appropriate answer? The first step is one you have almost certainly already done: knowing the signs and symptoms of infectious disease emergencies and urgencies. (Just in case, we will review them below). But then we must stay vigilant, and keep our index of suspicion high even after the H & P has been signed and attested.

### Emergencies

While there are a number of infectious disease urgencies, there are arguably only two infectious disease emergencies: **septic shock** and **epiglottitis**. Septic shock is a well defined entity, with a well defined protocol for treatment which calls for specific laboratory evaluations and therapeutic interventions to be completed on a short and prescribed timeline. At my institution, when a "sepsis stat" is called, the **attending** hospitalist is expected to show up at the patient's room within 5 minutes. This is because the clock is ticking, and we only have 60 minutes to complete the initial evaluation and treatment.

Epiglottitis is an emergency due to impending airway obstruction combined with the need for rapid assistance from anesthesia to sedate and intubate the patient. As a result of widespread vaccination against H. Influenza type B, this clinical entity is now very rare. However, it can still occur in unvaccinated children or as a result of other infectious organisms including Streptococcal and Staphylococcal species. 

### Urgencies

While not requiring your running shoes, there are several other infectious disease presentations that require prompt intervention. For the most part, these are closed space infections. These include intracranial abscess, septic joints, pyelonephritis with obstruction, orbital cellulitis with abscess, and parapharyngeal abscess with airway compromise. (Note that narrowing of the jugular vein or carotid artery is a common finding with infections of the deep neck spaces. This is almost never of any clinical importance. However, if there is concern for neurological signs due to compromised CNS perfusion, urgent discussion with appropriate specialists is warranted.)

When these entities are on the differential, prompt evaluation and empiric antibiotic coverage is indicated. When confirmed, prompt surgical intervention may be indicated, although whether this is the case will depend on details of the patient's clinical condition and imaging studies. At a minimum, the case should be discussed with the appropriate surgical specialist without delay. In the case of suspected septic joints, the orthopedic surgeon will be needed to assist in the diagnostic evaluation since joint aspiration is required.

Necrotizing fascitis is likewise a surgical urgency. While not involving a closed space *per se*, the fascial planes provide a super highway for disease progression. Empiric antibiotic therapy and rapid surgical debridement are the mainstays of treatment. 

While intra-abdominal processes requring rapid intervention are mostly non-infectious, there are a few infectious entities to keep in mind in this anatomical region. Though rare outside the neonatal ICU, necrotozing enterocolitis (NEC) can affect term infants [@33413665], as well as preterm infants who have left the NICU but are still near 40 weeks gestational age.  NEC requires prompt initiation of antibiotics, gut rest, and possibly evaluation by a pediatric surgeon if there is concern for perforation. Prompt initiation of empiric antibiotics are likewise indicated for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (very rare outside the population of patients receiving peritoneal dialysis), as well as for ascending cholangitis and perforated appendicitis (appendicitis is itself a *surgical* urgency, of course, but not technically of infectious etiology so is discussed elsewhere).

Finally, suspected meningitis requires prompt evaluation and empiric therapy. Selection of empiric therapy is age dependent, and is reviewed below.

## Bugs

Ultimately, the reason we are interested in which bacteria (if any) is the cause of our patient's disease is so that we can select the appropriate antibiotic. At the end of the day, we often have culture results including sensitivity analysis to guide us. However, the patient may require empiric therapy long before those results are available, or the patient may be discharged before culture results are finalized. In these scenarios it is important to understand what organisms are likely to be the cause of the pathology we are treating and select empiric therapy appropriately. In doing so, we balance off our desire to select the narrowest spectrum antibiotics possible with the need to ensure we are providing adequate treatment. How we weight those two competing priorities depends on how sick the patient is and how confident we are of our diagnosis. A patient in septic shock will require very broad empiric therapy including coverage for resistant organism. A patient with mild symptoms of cystitis can be treated with quite narrow spectrum agents knowing that therapy can be modified after culture results are available if our initial choice proves ineffective.

From the point of view of antibiotic spectrum, it is useful to divide infectious organisms into the following classes. **Commonly encountered** examples of each category are provided.

1. Gram Positive cocci
   * Streptococcal species
   * Staphylococcal species
   * Enterococcus species
   * Peptostreptococcus species
2. Gram Negative cocci
   * Neisseria species
   * Moraxella catarrhalis
   * Haemophilus influenza
3. Gram Positive rods
   * Clostridium difficile
   * Lysteria monocytogenes
   * Bacillus anthracis
   * Gardnerella vaginalis
4. Gram Negative Rods
   * Aerobic
     * Escherichia coli
     * Klebsiella pneumoniae
     * Salmonella enterica
     * Kingella kingae
     * Shigella species
     * Pseudomonas aeruginosa
   * Anaerobic
     * Bacillus fragilis
     * Campylobacter jejuni
     * Helicobacter pylori
     * Prevotella species
     * Fusobacterium species (including necrophorum)
     * Bacteriodes species
5. The "unstainables"
   * Mycoplasma

## Drugs

### Macrolides

Macrolides work by binding the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, thereby preventing protein synthesis in bacteria. As a result, unlike beta-lactams, they are effective against bacteria without cell walls (e.g. Mycoplasma species). However, macrolides have another interesting feature. They concentrate in phagocytic cells, such that intracellular levels may be 10-100 times higher than serum levels. For this reason, they are useful for intracellular organisms including C. Trachomatis, B. Henselae, and B. Pertussis (the latter two organisms are facultatively intracellular, while C. Trachomatis is an obligate intracellular organism). This is also the reason for the short duration of therapy used for Macrolides (5 days compared to the 7-14 days common for beta lactams) as they persist in immune cells after completion of therapy. However, as they concentrate intracellularly, they are not effective therapy for bacteremia as serum levels are relatively low. (There are exceptions, such as disseminated Mycobacterial infections in HIV patients.)

> 🗞 **Breaking News**: Due to increasing resistance, **azithromycin is no longer the recommended first line agent for STI** due to C. Trachomatis [@CDC2020]. Rather, doxycycline (100mg BID x 7 days) is recommended. If there are concerns about compliance, a single 1g dose of azithromycin remains an option (however, in this event it behooves the practitioner to explain the options to the patient and why you are suggesting the single dose despite the fact that the 7 day course of doxycycline is recommended, lest you slip into the pit of paternalism.)

Macrolides commonly used clinically are:

* Azithromycin
* Erythromycin
* Clarithromycin

Azithromycin is the best tolerated and is the most commonly used member of this class (except that Erythromycin is used with some frequency not for its antibiotic effect, but its pro-motile effects in the context of gastric dysmotility).

## Specific infections

### Animal Bites

Small animal bites (including dog and cats) may be infected by oral flora, most notably pasteurella species. Empiric therapy should be initiate if there is evidence of cellulitis, the bite involves the face or hands, or if the bite is "deep" or near deep structures.  Augmentin is the treatment of choice for empiric oral therapy. Parenteral therapy should be initiated if there are systemic signs or symptoms or concern for involvement of deep structures or rapidly progressing infection. In this case, ampicillin/sulbactam is an appropriate choice. If there is concern for allergy or MRSA, either ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin combined with clindamyin (or metronidazole if no MRSA concern) may be used.

Animal bites involving the face may be closed primarily if less than 24 hours old. Other animal inflicted lacerations can be closed if less than 12 hours old, although secondary intention is another option and may be preffered to minimize chance of developing anaerobic infection. Puncture wounds should not be closed, and animal bites should never be closed with glue.

# Rheumatology

Rheumatologic conditions are chronic and managed by sub specialists in the outpatient realm the vast majority of the time. However, familiarity with them is important for the pediatric hospitalist for two reasons. First, there are complications of these disease processes (and their treatment) that lead to hospitalization and require specific interventions. Secondly, these diseases are the ultimate diagnosis for many patients presenting with vague constellation of symptoms. A solid foundation of knowledge about these conditions can expedite consultation and facilitate and end to the diagnostic odyssey, thereby decreasing stress for provider and patient alike. For our purposes, we will discuss the following categories of rheumatologic diseases:

1. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
2. Vasculitides
3. Systemic lupus erythematosus
4. Autoimmune myopathies
5. Other rheumatologic conditions (Sjögren syndrome, hypermobillity, scleroderma, and recurrent fevers)

## Emergencies and Urgencies

While one does not expect to ever hear "Code ANA Room 525" paged overhead, there are a couple of situations that may arise in patients with rheumatological diseases that require prompt intervention. 

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) arising in a patient with a rheumatologic condition is referred to as "Macrophage Activation Syndrome" (MAS). MAS is potentially fatal and requires prompt intervention. HLH is reviewed in the Immunology and Allergy chapter. In contrast to HLH, MAS can often be treated with steroids alone (possibly with the addition of anakinra, and any other disease modifying agents needed to control the underlying rheumatologic condition). However, patients who are very ill, or decompensating despite steroid treatment, should be transitioned to the traditional HLH-94 protocol (or a clinical trial protocol if available at your institution). The HLH-94 protocol combines etoposide and cyclo**sporine** with intrathecal methotrexate and hydrocortisone if there are CNS symptoms. While diagnosis and treatment of HLH/MAS would be carried out with help from a rheumatologist, immunologist, and/or hematologist/oncologist, a high index of suspicion must be maintained for MAS in patients with a rheumatologic diagnosis presenting with fever, splenomegaly, CNS symptoms, and/or cytopenias. In this context, prompt acquisition of additional  laboratory evaluations (e.g. ferritin, and triglyceride levels, soluble IL2Ra/CD25 and NK cell function) and/or involvement of specialists will ensure efficient diagnosis and treatment. Note that IL2Ra/CD25 and NK cell function assays will take a while to come back, and therapy should not be delayed for deteriorating patients exhibiting other features consistent with HLH/MAS while waiting for those results.

Secondly, patients with rheumatologic conditions may be taking immunosuppressive agents. In such patients presenting with fever and an absolute neutrophil count <500, a blood culture should be drawn and broad spectrum antibiotics initiated within 60 minutes of presentation. Needless to say, patients with higher ANCs who are ill appearing also require prompt diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. While such patients typically present to the emergency department, this situation could arise in hospitalized patients during the course of their admission, so ongoing vigilance is indicated. These patients do not differ from any other patient with iatrogenic neutropenia and fever, however it is important to maintain awareness that this patient population may be neutropenic.

## Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) ##

JIA is defined as synovitis affecting one more joints for at least 6 weeks with an onset before 16 years of age. Although not terribly impactful on acute care of the hospitalized child, JIA is divided into seven categories, each with a unique set of clinical and laboratory features. These are summarized in the figure below. If you mentally keep the categories in the order shown, it makes it a *little* easier to remember age of onset and laboratory features. 

![JIA Categories](/Users/erikor/Projects/practical_hosp_peds/images/jia_types.png)

**Figure:** JIA categories

Note that while ANA is typically positive in Oligoarticular and Polyarticular JIA, this laboratory value is of little to no use when evaluating a patient for JIA (as opposed to SLE—see below—for which it is very useful). However, a positive ANA does identify patients at elevated risk of uveitis, which will help guide frequency of ophthalmology follow up. 

> ✅ JIA patients need ophthalmology evaluation every 3-12 months, depending on **1.** category of JIA (oligoarticular, RF- polyarticular, psoriatic, and undifferentiated JIA are high risk) **2.** age at diagnosis (<7 years of age is high risk), **3.** years since diagnosis (<5 years is high risk), and **4.** ANA status (positive ANA is high risk). Patients with all 4 of these risk factors should be screened every 3 months. Other JIA patients may be screened every 6-12 months. Uveitis can develop even in the absence of other disease symptoms and can lead to permanent damage, such as iris synechiae, if not treated.  Ensure that a newly diagnosed JIA patient has ophthalmology follow up arranged at discharge.

Systemic symptoms of JIA include fever, weight loss, fatigue, migrating salmon colored rash, pericarditis, myocarditis, myalgia, and myositis. Left untreated, JIA can result in destruction of the joint and loss of function. JIA patients are at risk of developing MAS as discussed in the Emergencies and Urgencies section above, and further discussed in the section on HLH in the Allergy and Immunology chapter. Additional complications of JIA are related to its treatment. In particular, chronic steroid use is associated with avascular necrosis of bone, growth inhibition, and immunosuppression. For this reason, one of the goals of therapy is minimization of systemic steroid use. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may also lead to immunosuppression, which must be kept in mind when admitting a patient with JIA presenting for fever or other concerns for infectious disease.

The mainstays of treatment of JIA are non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) and the DMARD methotrexate (some patients with mild disease may initially be treated with NSAIDs alone, while initial treatment for other patients may include both NSAIDs and methotrexate). Symptoms affecting only one or a few joints can be treated with intra-articular steroid injection. Flares can be managed with systemic steroids, but if need for steroids is frequent or prolonged despite methotrexate treatment, other DMARDs may be used (typically biologics, such as the TNFα inhibitors etanercept or infliximab).

> * NSAIDs
> * Methotrexate

## Vasculitides

While not terribly useful at the bedside, the vasculitides are, like JIA, divided into a number of categories. For the vasculitides they are classified based on the size of vessel affected—which you will not be able to determine with any of the tools available in your pocket or the patient's room. Nevertheless, this categorization does divide the relevant diagnoses up into bite size chunks. As in all areas of medicine, eponyms are being replaced with descriptive names. Here, we will provide both the new names and the eponyms to facilitate this transition.

### Small vessel vasculitides

**IgA vasculitis** (IgAV, formerly Henoch-Schönlein Purpura): This condition is characterized by a purpuric rash that is most prevalent dependent regions of the body (legs, buttocks, etc.). It is usually easily distinguished from the purpura that may accompany meningococcal meningitis (or other infectious causes of severe systemic illness leading to capillary leak) by the fact the characteristic distribution of the rash combined with the fact that patients with IgA vasculitis are relatively well appearing (compared to the toxic appearance of patients with systemic infections). 

The purpuric rash of IgAV is the most common clinical finding, followed by arthritis, abdominal pain, nephropathy, and, most rarely, orchitis and pulmonary hemorrhage. Hospital admission is required for severe pain or inability to maintain hydration orally or significant organ dysfunction (GI bleeding, kidney injury, or altered mental status). For patients with symptoms severe enough to warrant hospital admission, steroids may be considered, although clear evidence that steroids favorably impact outcomes is missing (although personal experiences of prompt improvement of symptoms with steroid use are hard to shake off.)

> :pill: **Treatment of IgA vasculitis**
>
> * Treatment of IgA vasculitis is supportive, with additional interventions targeting the sequelae of organ dysfunction (e.g. anti-hypertensives for hypertension in the setting of AKI, or surgical reduction of small bowel intussusception). 
>* NSAIDs may be used unless there is evidence of GI bleeding or renal involvement. 
> * Steroid use is controversial, but may provide symptomatic relief for abdominal pain or arthritis.
> * If steroids are used, **a long taper (4-8 weeks) is recommended** to prevent resurgence of symptoms.

While IgAV usually follows a benign course, it holds the potential for serious intestinal, renal, and CNS complications. The vasculitis may lead to intussusception (including ileo-ileal intussusception which will be missed by barium enema), intestinal hemorrhage, hypertensive emergencies, hemorrhagic stroke, and kidney injury. Thus, a careful assessment of disease severity is required when deciding between inpatient and outpatient management, and patients being discharged must be counseled on signs and symptoms that would indicated need to return for care.

All patients with IgAV require outpatient monitoring for development of renal disease. Some PCPs may ask for guidance from the pediatric hospitalist as to what the follow up schedule should be. One possible regiment is detailed in the box below.

> :white_check_mark: **Outpatient monitoring for IgAV patients**
>
> Patients without evidence of renal involvement at discharge should be monitored for development of renal disease by checking blood pressure and UA at regular intervals. One possible schedule is as follows:
>
> * Weekly x 8
> * Monthly x 6
> * Every other month x 3
> * Then annually
>
> Note that patients with evidence of renal involvement at discharge should be followed by a pediatric nephrologist, who will help determine the appropriate follow up timing.

**Serum Sickness and Serum Sickness-Like Reaction (SSLR)**: Serum sickness and SSLR are small vessel vasculitides that represent the prototypical Type III hypersensitivity reaction (deposition of antibody-antigen complexes). True serum sickness involves a reaction to foreign protein antigen. As a type III reaction, formation of antibodies is required, and as a result the reaction takes 1-2 weeks to emerge. If the patients has had a prior exposure to the agent, however, symptoms may develop much more quickly. Historically the inciting agent has been animal serum or antibodies used as antidotes to venomous animal bites. Recent development of immune-modulating antibodies used in the treatment of cancer and rheumatologic diseases (e.g. rituximab) has added to the list of potential inciting agents. In addition, many drugs can provoke a similar Type III reaction despite not being proteins. In this latter case, the resulting disease is termed "Serum Sickness-Like Reaction", since the pathology is (usually) the same but no exogenous serum is involved.

The hallmark of these vasculitides is fever, arthralgia, and an urticarial rash with central clearing. As they become confluent, the border takes on a serpiginous appearance. Serum complement levels are depressed. The treatment for these conditions is discontinuation of the offending agent, and, if necessary, NSAIDs and/or steroids.

> * Discontinuation of inciting agent
> * NSAIDs (if necessary)
> * Steroids (if necessary)

The presentation of serum sickness and SSLR can be difficult to distinguish from other conditions presenting with fever and rash, especially early in the disease course. Key differentiating factors are presented in the table below.

| Condition             | Palm/Sole involvement | Mucous Membrane Involvement |    Painful Rash    | Blistering/Peeling |
| --------------------- | :-------------------: | :-------------------------: | :----------------: | :----------------: |

**Table:** Comparison of several conditions presenting with fever and rash. *TEN = toxic epidermal necrolysis

Serum sickness and SSLR can be distinguished from Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) by the absence of other systemic symptoms (such as elevated liver enzymes), and from Steven-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis by the fact that the rash of serum sickness is itchy, not painful, and there is no blistering or mucous membrane involvement. Involvement of mucous membranes also differentiated Kawasaki Disease, as does involvement of palms and soled.

**Other vasculitic drug reactions**: In addition to serum sickness and SSLR, many antibiotics and anti-convulsive medications (as well as others) can cause a small vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitis manifesting as ulcerative or purpuric lesions affecting skin and, in some cases, other organs. Treatment is similar to that for serum sickness and SSLR: discontinuation of the offending agent, with other therapy as needed to address organ involvement. Steroids may be indicated depending of severity of symptoms.

### Medium vessel vasculitides

**Kawasaki Disease:** This well known condition is the prototypical medium vessel vasculitis. The diagnosis requires 5 days of fever and at least 4 of the clinical features listed in the box below.

> **Kawasaki Disease Clinical Criteria**
>
> 5 days of fever and at least four of the following:
>
> * Bilateral conjunctivitis without exudate
> * Oral mucous membrane changes (strawberry tongue, erythema/fissuring of lips)
> * Swelling or erythema of palms and/or soles (or, later in the disease, desquamation)
> * Rash
> * Cervical lymphadenopathy with at least one node <u>></u>1.5 cm

More common, however, is the child with 5 days of fever and only 2 or 3 of the clinical criteria. Such patients may be diagnosed with incomplete Kawasaki disease if the CRP is <u>></u>3 mg/dl or the ESR is <u>></u> 40 mm/hr **and** the patient has an abnormal ECHO or <u>></u>3 supplemental laboratory criteria as listed in the box below.

> **Kawasaki Disease Supplemental Laboratory Criteria**
>
> 5 days of fever, 2 or 3 clinical features (see box above) **and either**
>
> * Abnormal ECHO **or**
> * 3 or more of:
>   * Anemia
>   * Platelets >450,000 (after 7 days of fever)
>   * Albumin <u><</u>3.0 g/dl
>   * Elevated A**L**T
>   * WBC count <u>></u>15,000mm<sup>3</sup>
>   * <u>></u>10 WBC/hpf on UA

The treatment of complete and incomplete Kawasaki disease is the same: IVIG (2g/kg) and aspirin (30-50mg/kg/day divided q6 hours). If the patient fails to defervesce in 36 hours, the IVIG may be repeated or prednisone (1mg/kg BID for 5 days followed by 0.5mg/kg daily for 5 days) may be given. 

> :white_check_mark: **Aspirin may be held** for patients with active influenza or varicella infections, or known exposure, to reduce risk of Reye syndrome.

Note that some patients can be identified who are at high risk of IVIG failure (see box below). These patients should receive prednisone (2mg/kg, then 1 mg/kg, then 0.5mg/kg, each for 5 days) in addition to IVIG **as initial treatment**.

> :pill: **Treatment of Kawasaki Disease**
>
> **Initial**
>
> * IVIG (2g/kg)
> * Aspirin (30-50mg/kg divided q6)
> * If high risk (see below), **add** prednisone (2mg/kg, then 1 mg/kg, then 0.5mg/kg, each for 5 days)
>
> **Salvage**
>
> * Repeat IVIG (2g/kg) **or**
> * Prednisone (1mg/kg BID for 5 days followed by 0.5mg/kg daily for 5 days)
> * If high risk (see below), use **two** of the following: 
>   * IVIG
>   * Prednisone
>   * Infliximab
> * If patient fails salvage therapy, consult rheumatology or infectious disease for help selecting next therapy which may include anakinra, tocilizumab, cyclo**sporine**, cyclo**phosphamide**, or plasmapharesis.
>
> **Post-defervescence treatment and monitoring**
>
> * Once the patient has been afebrile for about 48 hours, the aspirin dose may be reduced to 3-5mg/kg/day. **Some in the field recommend continuing high dose aspirin for 7-10 days before transitioning to low dose**.
>
> * Patients should follow up with cardiology at 4-6 weeks.
>
> * Aspirin may be discontinued at that point if the patient has no aneurysms (even if there is mild, or at least improving, dilation)

If the patient fails to defervesce after the second dose of IVIG, there are numerous options including cyclo**sporine**, cyclophosphamide, plasmapharesis, anakinra (IL-1 inhibitor), tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor), or others. Such patients should be managed with the assistance of a rheumatologist or infectious disease consultant who are familiar with these agents and can help identify the ideal therapy.

**Note that patients with severe disease (coronary artery z-score <u>></u> 10 or aneursyms increasing in size) failing initial therapy should receive combination therapy for salvage therapy.** Such therapy could include two of the following: IVIG, prednisone, infliximab. Again, input from a rheumatologic or infectious disease colleague would be very helpful in this situation.

> - C-reactive protein >13 mg/dL (1 point)

**Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN):** PAN is far more common in adults, but can occur in children. The hallmarks of PAN are painful skin nodules accompanies by mono-neuropathies evolving into poly-neuropathy. Systemic symptoms, hypertension, and renal disease may also be present. ANCA is negative in PAN, and diagnosis is by biopsy. Treatment is steroids, with cyclo**phosphamide** pulses or other immunomodulators if needed.

### Large Vessel Vasculitis ###

**Takayasu Ateritis (TA):** TA features granulomas affecting the large vessels leading to decreased pressure in the aorta or other large arteries. The disease manifests as decreased blood pressure in one or more limbs, decreased pulses, hypertension, and bruits over major arteries. The vascular abnormalities can be seen on CT or MRA. As with PAN, treatment is steroids and cyclo**phosphamide** or other immunomodulators if needed. Persistent stenoses may require surgical correction.

### Mixed vessel vasculitis

**Behçet Disease:** Recurrent (at least three time per year) buccal mucous membrane ulcers should prompt consideration of this condition which also causes genital ulcers, arthritis, and ocular symptoms including uveitis and papilledema. (This constellation of symptoms have led to the mnemonic "can't see, can't pee, can't climb a tree".) Patients can also present with necrotic folliculitis, GI and pulmonary involvement, and erythema nodosum. Treatment is with local or systemic steroids, with possible addition of colchicine and pentoxifylline (for ulceration), or azathioprine for severe disease. 

**Childhood primary angiitis of the CNS (cPACNS):** This frightening sounding condition can cause a wide spectrum of CNS related symptoms, including psychosis, headache, seizures, focal deficits, and stroke. The condition has two forms: small-vessel, and medium- and large-vessel disease. Medium- and large-vessel cPACNS will have abnormal angiography. Large-vessel disease may be accompanied by normal inflammatory markers. MRA is the imaging of choice, but leptomeningeal biopsy may be needed to diagnose small vessel disease. Treatment is with steroids and cyclophosphamide (if disease is progressive). Therapies targeting specific sequelae are also indicated (e.g. anti-coagulation for acute stroke). 

## Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)

Case presentation: Your 12 year old patient presents with some symptoms. What is your diagnosis? If you said "SLE" you could be right!

There are several classifications systems that can be used for making the diagnosis of SLE, of which the most recent is the 2019 EULAR/ACR system [@31385462]. While these systems are useful for clinical trials and research, as well as remembering the range of features of the disease process, it is important to remember that a patient need not meet these criteria to warrant initiation of treatment. For example, the EULAR/ACR system requires an ANA titer of 1:80 as the "entry point" into the algorithm. However, lower titers (say, up to 1:250) combined with other clinical features of SLE should prompt further investigation/consultation and therapy depending on the results of those maneuvers.

The classic symptoms of SLE are malar rash, arthritis, serositis, and nephritis. However, the presentation is often much more subtle. Unexplained constitutional symptoms (fatigue, fever, weight loss) or new onset psychosis should prompt consideration of SLE. At a minimum, in the absence of a clear alternative diagnosis, an ANA should be checked for such patients. A negative ANA reduces the probability of SLE to 1-2%, which combined with a low pre-test probability may be sufficient to rule out the diagnosis, or at least put it on the shelf for the time being. See the list below for additional clinical manifestations of SLE.

A positive ANA should prompt further laboratory investigation (CBC, renal panel, UA, C3, C4, anti-dsDNA, anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-RNP, anti-cardiolipin, lupus anti-coagulant, direct Coombs). If the patient is febrile, MAS labs (ferritin, triglycerides, IL2Ra/CD25, and NK cell function) should also be checked. If these evaluations reveal abnormalities, consultations to pediatric rheumatology and/or nephrology is indicated.

> :white_check_mark: A teenaged female with unexplained persistent thrombocytopenia should be evaluated for SLE.

The mainstay of treatment for SLE is hydroxychloroquine. Many patients also require steroids for adequate disease control. The lowest possible dose is used (often starting at 0.25mg/kg for prednisone). If higher doses and/or prolonged courses are required, additional medications may be added to reduce steroid dependency. These typically include mycophenylate mofetil or azathioprine. For moderate to severe disease (e.g. as defined by extent of renal involvement), cyclophosphamide (<u>+</u> rituximab) may be required to induce remission. Management of renal, cardiac, pulmonary, dermatologic, and hematologic complications may require additional targeted therapies.
